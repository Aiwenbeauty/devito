    "The comparisons are based on the *Standard Test* employed in all notebooks. As a reference solution, that will be considered as the \"correct\" solution when measuring errors, we take a solution computed on a larger domain (we extend the domain in the left, right and bottom part, extending the velocity field with constant values, equal to the values the field has at the original left, right and bottom, respectively). The new depth in the reference run is $3.0Km$ and the domain is also wider, we employ a domain from $-1.5 Km$ to $2.5 Km$. For running the reference run we use PML boundary conditions (20 grid points in the extension zone). The comparisons are made only in the domain of the  *Standard Test*. Due to the extended domain of the reference run, we should not expect to see spurious reflections in its results in the time of simulation.  We will make comparison of the wave displacements as well as of the shot records in the receivers. The methods are referred as:\n",

    "- The most effective methods in reducing the spurious reflections are PML and HABC. Their results in terms of accuracy (with respect to a reference solution) are similar, making these methods quite interesting for applications. Notice that PML is very popular, but the Hybrid methods offer an interesting alternative to it. Which one to choose will depend on the computational performance of the methods on a given platform. In this sense, the Devito implementations could be of great help to have optimized codes, including their parallelization, with no extra effort, besides getting portability among different computer platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Schemes as Damping or HABC A1, although simpler and potentially cheaper, are not so effective in reducing reflections, what make their pratical use somewhat more limited."
