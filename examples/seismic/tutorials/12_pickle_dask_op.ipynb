    "\n",
    "Here, we revisit the fourth tutorial ([FWI with dask](https://github.com/devitocodes/devito/blob/master/examples/seismic/tutorials/04_dask.ipynb)), but with a twist: we now want to show that is possible to use pickle to serialize (deserialize) a Devito object structure into (from) a byte stream. This is specially useful in our example as the geometry of all source experiments remains essentially the same; only the source location changes. In other words, we can convert a solver object into a byte stream to store it. Later on, this byte stream can then be retrieved and de-serialized back to an instance of the original solver object by the dask workers, and then be populate with the correct geometry for the i-th source location. We can still benefit from the simplicity of the example and create only one solver object which can be used to both generate the observed data set and to compute the predicted data and gradient in the FWI process. Further examples of pickling can be found [here](https://github.com/devitocodes/devito/blob/master/tests/test_pickle.py)"
